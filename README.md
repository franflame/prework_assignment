## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   I used Google to reference CSS name colors, fonts, and HTML syntax.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   I encountered some challenges with minor syntax errors that caused certain things to not work,
   but otherwise the tutorial was easy to follow. My biggest issue had to do with the button background color because
   what happened was that the background color wouldn't work. Turns out that I added an extra ; where there shouldn't have been.
   This slowed me down a bit, but I reviewed the example syntax again and found my error.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I want to more about how building websites work in general. Do any other programming languages work for it?
   How do I ensure that my site works on different window sizes?
   How do I handle mobile device users on browser?

4) If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I would work on implementing those optional features and create more customization. I would consider making a song
   out of the pattern that is shown.
